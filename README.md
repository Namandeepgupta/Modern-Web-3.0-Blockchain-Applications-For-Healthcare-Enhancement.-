🩺 Modern Web 3.0 Blockchain Applications for Healthcare Enhancement
This project leverages Web 3.0 technologies and blockchain to revolutionize healthcare systems by ensuring secure, decentralized, and transparent handling of patient data. It integrates smart contracts for automating healthcare workflows and supports cryptocurrency-based incentives and transactions within the ecosystem.

✅ Project Features
🔹 Core Functionalities
Decentralized storage of medical records

Patient-controlled access to data (via blockchain)

Smart contracts for appointment scheduling and insurance claims

Crypto wallet integration for payments and rewards

Secure doctor-patient data sharing with immutable logs

🌐 Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js / HTML / CSS (optional based on implementation)

Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity (Smart Contracts)

Wallet Integration: MetaMask

Web 3.0 Interaction: Web3.js / Ethers.js

Backend (if any): Node.js / Express.js

Database (optional): IPFS / Firebase (for metadata or logs)

🧪 Testing & Validation
Smart contract testing using Remix IDE and Ganache

Role-based access validation for patients and doctors

Blockchain transaction verification through MetaMask

Form input validation for patient registration and record upload

Use of test networks (Rinkeby, Goerli) for simulation

📈 Future Enhancements
Integration with government health records

NFT-based tokenization of health assets

AI diagnostics recommendation engine

HIPAA/GDPR compliance integration

DApp deployment to mainnet (Ethereum/Polygon)

🗂️ Data Flow & Structure
User Roles: Patient, Doctor, Admin

Data Stored: Medical History, Reports, Prescriptions, Payment Logs

Security: Blockchain immutability, decentralized access control

Smart Contracts:

HealthRecords.sol – store/update access-controlled patient data

Appointment.sol – manage doctor bookings

Insurance.sol – automate claim verification

Interact with contracts and features

👨‍⚕️ Use Case Example
A patient uploads their encrypted medical report. A doctor requests access via a smart contract. Upon patient approval, access is granted, and the interaction is recorded on-chain. Payments for services are handled in cryptocurrency.
